# CiThruS2 Simulation Framework

CiThruS2 (See-Through Sight 2) is a simulation framework and virtual city environment built in Unreal Engine 5 to aid in testing and developing various traffic-related systems, drone systems and vision-based systems. The environment is based on the real suburb of Hervanta in Tampere, Finland, and it supports features such as simulated cars, pedestrians, cyclists, weather, seasonal effects, a changeable time of day, as well as real-time video streaming, recording, and receiving.

## Old Unreal Engine versions

Old versions of CiThruS2 for older Unreal Engine versions are available on separate branches. They do not have the latest features and will no longer be updated, but they are otherwise usable. To avoid version conflicts while switching branches, we recommend first deleting all files generated by the setup script and Unreal Engine and then regenerating them from scratch on the new branch.

## Papers

If you are using CiThruS2 in your research **with a focus on ground vehicles and traffic**, please cite the following paper:

If you are using CiThruS2 in your research **with a focus on UAVs/drones**, please cite the following paper: 

`E. Gałązka, A. Leppäaho, and J. Vanne, “CiThruS2: open-source virtual environment for simulating real-time drone operations and piloting,” in Proc. IEEE Int. Automated Vehicle Validation Conf., Austin, Texas, USA, Oct. 2023. `

In other kinds of research, please cite the one you believe to be the most appropriate. If you're not sure which one to choose, we recommend the most recent paper.
